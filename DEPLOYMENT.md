# Isometry React Prototype - Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment Options

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended for immediate deployment)

**Already configured!** Just enable GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" section
3. Set source to "GitHub Actions"
4. Push to main branch triggers automatic deployment
5. Site will be available at: `https://mshaler.github.io/Isometry/`

**Benefits:**
- Zero configuration required
- Automatic deployment on push
- Free hosting
- HTTPS by default
- Good performance via GitHub CDN

### Option 2: Netlify (Best for production)

**Drag & Drop Method (Fastest):**
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Drag the `/dist` folder to the deployment area
3. Site goes live immediately
4. Get custom URL like `https://amazing-site-name.netlify.app`

**CLI Method (Automated):**
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login and deploy
netlify login
netlify init
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

**GitHub Integration:**
- Connect your GitHub repo to Netlify
- Automatic deployment on every push
- Branch previews for PRs
- Built-in form handling and functions

### Option 3: Vercel (When authentication is resolved)

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

## Performance Optimizations Included

### Build Optimizations
- **Bundle Size:** 159.74KB gzipped (production ready)
- **Code Splitting:** Vendor, D3, Radix UI, Icons separated
- **Tree Shaking:** Unused code eliminated
- **Minification:** Terser for optimal compression
- **Source Maps:** Available for debugging

### Caching Strategy
- **Static Assets:** 1 year cache with immutable headers
- **WASM Files:** Optimized caching for sql-wasm.wasm
- **CSS/JS:** Fingerprinted filenames for cache busting

### Security Headers
- CSP configured for XSS protection
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- HTTPS redirect enforced
- Referrer policy optimized

## Custom Domain Setup

### For Netlify:
1. Go to Site Settings > Domain management
2. Add custom domain
3. Configure DNS records as shown

### For GitHub Pages:
1. Repository Settings > Pages
2. Add custom domain in "Custom domain" field
3. Create CNAME record pointing to `mshaler.github.io`

## Analytics Integration

### Google Analytics 4
Add to `index.html` before `</head>`:
```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID');
</script>
```

### Netlify Analytics
- Built-in server-side analytics
- No tracking scripts required
- GDPR compliant

## Monitoring & Performance

### Lighthouse Integration
- Automated performance audits on deploy
- Performance budget enforcement
- Accessibility checks

## Migration Path to Vercel

When Vercel authentication is resolved:

1. Import GitHub repo to Vercel
2. Configure build settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm ci`
3. Environment variables (if any)
4. Custom domain transfer
5. DNS update
