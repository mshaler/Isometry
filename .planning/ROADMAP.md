# Roadmap: Isometry v5

## Overview

Isometry v5 builds a local-first polymorphic data projection platform where sql.js (WASM with FTS5) serves as the single source of truth and D3.js data joins serve as state management -- no framework, no parallel state store. The build is dependency-driven: database foundation first, then CRUD and query functions, then Worker Bridge, then Providers and Views. The web runtime ships as a complete unit. v2.0 wraps that runtime in a native SwiftUI multiplatform shell. v3.0 completes SuperGrid as a fully dynamic, interactive PAFV projection surface. v3.1 extends SuperGrid to N-level axis stacking with collapsible headers, aggregate/hide collapse modes, drag reorder, and full compound D3 keying. v4.0 adds native macOS importers for Apple Notes, Reminders, and Calendar via direct system database reads. v4.1 adds visual intelligence (change tracking, source provenance, calculated field distinction), virtual scrolling for SuperGrid at scale, and full cross-device CloudKit record-level sync replacing iCloud Documents file sync. v4.2 cleans up build pipeline, fills UX gaps (empty states, keyboard shortcuts, visual polish), hardens stability, and validates end-to-end ETL across all sources and views. v4.3 fixes runtime correctness bugs identified by Codex code review (Excel ArrayBuffer import, ? shortcut shift matching, undo/redo toast wiring) and cleans up Biome lint drift and planning doc staleness.

### v4.3 Review Fixes (Phase 48)

**Milestone Goal:** Fix runtime correctness bugs and process gaps identified by Codex code review -- broken Excel web import, non-functional ? shortcut on US keyboards, missing undo/redo toast in runtime path, Biome lint drift, and stale planning docs.

- [ ] **Phase 48: Review Fixes** - Excel ArrayBuffer import, ? shortcut shift matching, undo/redo toast wiring, Biome lint cleanup, planning doc reconciliation

## Phase Details

### Phase 48: Review Fixes
**Goal**: Fix all runtime correctness bugs and process gaps identified by Codex code review -- every shipped feature works correctly in real browsers, lint gate holds, and planning docs are accurate
**Depends on**: Nothing (first and only phase of v4.3)
**Requirements**: RFIX-01, RFIX-02, RFIX-03, BFIX-01, DFIX-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can import .xlsx/.xls files via web file picker and see cards rendered correctly (ArrayBuffer path end-to-end)
  2. User can press ? on a US-layout keyboard (Shift+/) to toggle the help overlay in any real browser (shiftKey matching fixed)
  3. User sees brief "Undid: {description}" / "Redid: {description}" toast after Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z in runtime path
  4. `npx biome check src tests` passes with zero errors on all source and test files at repo HEAD
  5. ROADMAP.md, PROJECT.md, and STATE.md consistently reflect v4.2 as shipped and v4.3 as current
**Plans:** 2 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 48-01-PLAN.md -- Excel ArrayBuffer fix, ? shortcut shift fix, undo/redo toast wiring
- [ ] 48-02-PLAN.md -- Biome lint cleanup, planning doc reconciliation

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order. Phases 1-47 complete across 10 milestones. Phase 48 is v4.3 Review Fixes.

| Phase | Milestone | Plans Complete | Status | Completed |
|-------|-----------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| 1-47 | v0.1-v4.2 | 143/143 | Complete | 2026-02-28 to 2026-03-07 |
| 48. Review Fixes | v4.3 | 0/2 | Pending | - |
