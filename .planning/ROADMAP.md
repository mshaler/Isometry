# Roadmap: Isometry v4.1 SuperGrid Foundation

## Overview

Implement the core SuperGrid polymorphic data projection system through four phases: foundation stabilization with sql.js integration, PAFV grid core with dynamic axis assignment, SuperGrid nested headers with hierarchical spanning, and grid continuum transitions. This roadmap transforms the proven v3.1 live database architecture into the keystone SuperGrid visualization platform with bridge elimination benefits.
