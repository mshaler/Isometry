# Roadmap: Isometry v5

## Overview

Isometry v5 builds a local-first polymorphic data projection platform where sql.js (WASM with FTS5) serves as the single source of truth and D3.js data joins serve as state management -- no framework, no parallel state store. The build is dependency-driven: database foundation first, then CRUD and query functions, then Worker Bridge, then Providers and Views. The web runtime ships as a complete unit. v2.0 wraps that runtime in a native SwiftUI multiplatform shell. v3.0 completes SuperGrid as a fully dynamic, interactive PAFV projection surface. v3.1 extends SuperGrid to N-level axis stacking with collapsible headers, aggregate/hide collapse modes, drag reorder, and full compound D3 keying. v4.0 adds native macOS importers for Apple Notes, Reminders, and Calendar via direct system database reads. v4.1 adds visual intelligence (change tracking, source provenance, calculated field distinction), virtual scrolling for SuperGrid at scale, and full cross-device CloudKit record-level sync replacing iCloud Documents file sync. v4.2 cleans up build pipeline, fills UX gaps (empty states, keyboard shortcuts, visual polish), hardens stability, and validates end-to-end ETL across all sources and views. v4.3 fixes runtime correctness bugs identified by Codex code review. v4.4 makes the app fully accessible, discoverable, and theme-aware -- command palette as universal entry point, full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, light/dark/system theming, and guided empty states with sample data. v5.0 replaces the flat view layout with a Figma-designed Workbench shell -- a vertical stack of collapsible explorer panels (Properties, Projection, Visual, LATCH, Notebook) that drive SuperGrid through existing providers with zero new dependencies. v5.1 makes SuperGrid's spreadsheet mode perceptually read as a genuine spreadsheet through CSS visual baseline tokens, value-first cell rendering, row index gutter, and active cell focus model. v5.2 adds SQL-driven aggregate calculations to SuperGrid footer rows, completes the Workbench notebook with formatting toolbar + embedded D3 charts + database persistence, and ships LATCH Phase B subpanes (histogram scrubbers + category chips). v5.3 replaces all hardcoded schema assumptions with runtime PRAGMA introspection, fixes SVG and deleted_at bugs, migrates persisted state to handle dynamic fields, and enables user-configurable LATCH family mappings. v6.0 makes the app ship-ready at 20K-card scale: profile-first instrumentation across all 4 performance domains, targeted optimization of the dominant bottlenecks identified by data, and automated regression guards that prevent future PRs from silently regressing performance. v6.1 hardens every critical data seam with integration tests that exercise real sql.js and real providers -- the quality gate for v7.0 entry. v7.0 delivers the Design Workbench: a production shell with centered menubar, 8-section sidebar, ViewZipper auto-cycling, self-reflecting Data Explorer catalog, and three named themes. v7.1 wires the Notebook panel into MutationManager as a full card editor: inline title/content editing with shadow-buffer undo safety, start-typing card creation, typed property inputs for all 26 schema fields, and CSS-driven card dimension rendering. v7.2 retrofits Alto Index import infrastructure and ETL test harness (shipped ad-hoc), then migrates all remaining HTML5 DnD surfaces to pointer events so every drag interaction works in WKWebView.

### v7.2 Alto Index + DnD Migration (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Retrofit documentation for the Alto Index import adapter, ETL test harness, and Projection Explorer pointer-DnD work that shipped ad-hoc (Phase 95), then migrate all remaining HTML5 DnD surfaces in SuperGrid and KanbanView to pointer events so every drag interaction works in WKWebView without native interference (Phase 96).

- [x] **Phase 95: Alto Index + ETL Test Harness + Projection DnD** - Retrofit of ad-hoc shipped work: AltoIndexAdapter for 11 subdirectories, YAML frontmatter parser, source dedup, ETL load test with 15 assertions, full 20K-card test, and pointer-based DnD for Projection Explorer wells (completed 2026-03-19)
- [ ] **Phase 96: DnD Migration** - Migrate SuperGrid axis grip reorder, cross-dimension transpose, KanbanView card drag, and DataExplorerPanel file drop to pointer events consistent with ProjectionExplorer pattern

## Phase Details

### Phase 95: Alto Index + ETL Test Harness + Projection DnD
**Goal**: Alto Index data is importable from all 11 subdirectories, the ETL pipeline is validated end-to-end at 20K-card scale, and Projection Explorer chip drag works in WKWebView
**Depends on**: Phase 94 (v7.1 complete)
**Requirements**: ALTO-01, ALTO-02, ALTO-03, ALTO-04, ALTO-05, ALTO-06, TEST-01, TEST-02, TEST-03, TEST-04, PROJ-01, PROJ-02, PROJ-03, PROJ-04, PROJ-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can import from alto-index and cards from all 11 subdirectory types (notes, contacts, calendar, messages, books, calls, safari-history, kindle, reminders, safari-bookmarks, voice-memos) appear with correct card_type in SuperGrid
  2. Re-importing from alto-index produces no duplicate cards -- source dedup via file-path-based source_id is idempotent
  3. User can drag axis chips between X-plane and Y-plane wells in the Projection Explorer while running inside the native WKWebView shell
  4. The ETL load test runs to completion with 15 correctness assertions passing (LOAD, GRID, CALC, DEDUP, FTS, CATALOG) against the combined fixture dataset
  5. User can access File → Import from... (Shift+Cmd+I) from the macOS menu bar even when the native toolbar is hidden
**Plans**: 0 plans (shipped -- retrofit documentation only)

### Phase 96: DnD Migration
**Goal**: All HTML5 DnD surfaces in the application use pointer events so drag interactions work in WKWebView without native macOS drag interference
**Depends on**: Phase 95
**Requirements**: DND-01, DND-02, DND-03, DND-04, DND-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can drag a row axis header grip to reorder axes within the row dimension in WKWebView -- the axis reorders and SuperGrid re-renders immediately
  2. User can drag a row axis header into the column drop zone (and vice versa) to transpose axes in WKWebView -- the axis moves across dimensions correctly
  3. User can drag a card between Kanban columns in WKWebView -- the card's axis value updates and the card appears in the destination column
  4. User can import files into the DataExplorerPanel via drag-and-drop in WKWebView, or via a click-to-browse fallback that is clearly discoverable
  5. All pointer DnD interactions show a ghost element under the cursor, highlight the target drop zone, and update the cursor to indicate a valid drop -- matching the Projection Explorer pattern established in Phase 95
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 96-01-PLAN.md -- SuperGrid axis grip reorder + cross-dimension transpose pointer DnD
- [ ] 96-02-PLAN.md -- KanbanView card drag + DataExplorerPanel file drop pointer DnD

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order. Phases 1-94 complete across 21 milestones. Phase 53 is reserved.
