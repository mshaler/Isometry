# Roadmap: Isometry v5

## Overview

Isometry v5 builds a local-first polymorphic data projection platform where sql.js (WASM with FTS5) serves as the single source of truth and D3.js data joins serve as state management -- no framework, no parallel state store. The build is dependency-driven: database foundation first, then CRUD and query functions, then Worker Bridge, then Providers and Views. The web runtime ships as a complete unit. v2.0 wraps that runtime in a native SwiftUI multiplatform shell. v3.0 completes SuperGrid as a fully dynamic, interactive PAFV projection surface. v3.1 extends SuperGrid to N-level axis stacking with collapsible headers, aggregate/hide collapse modes, drag reorder, and full compound D3 keying. v4.0 adds native macOS importers for Apple Notes, Reminders, and Calendar via direct system database reads. v4.1 adds visual intelligence (change tracking, source provenance, calculated field distinction), virtual scrolling for SuperGrid at scale, and full cross-device CloudKit record-level sync replacing iCloud Documents file sync. v4.2 cleans up build pipeline, fills UX gaps (empty states, keyboard shortcuts, visual polish), hardens stability, and validates end-to-end ETL across all sources and views. v4.3 fixes runtime correctness bugs identified by Codex code review. v4.4 makes the app fully accessible, discoverable, and theme-aware -- command palette as universal entry point, full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, light/dark/system theming, and guided empty states with sample data. v5.0 replaces the flat view layout with a Figma-designed Workbench shell -- a vertical stack of collapsible explorer panels (Properties, Projection, Visual, LATCH, Notebook) that drive SuperGrid through existing providers with zero new dependencies. v5.1 makes SuperGrid's spreadsheet mode perceptually read as a genuine spreadsheet through CSS visual baseline tokens, value-first cell rendering, row index gutter, and active cell focus model. v5.2 adds SQL-driven aggregate calculations to SuperGrid footer rows, completes the Workbench notebook with formatting toolbar + embedded D3 charts + database persistence, and ships LATCH Phase B subpanes (histogram scrubbers + category chips). v5.3 replaces all hardcoded schema assumptions with runtime PRAGMA introspection, fixes SVG and deleted_at bugs, migrates persisted state to handle dynamic fields, and enables user-configurable LATCH family mappings. v6.0 makes the app ship-ready at 20K-card scale: profile-first instrumentation across all 4 performance domains, targeted optimization of the dominant bottlenecks identified by data, and automated regression guards that prevent future PRs from silently regressing performance. v6.1 hardens every critical data seam with integration tests that exercise real sql.js and real providers -- the quality gate for v7.0 entry.

### v7.0 Design Workbench (Phases 85-90)

v7.0 restructures the Workbench shell based on UAT feedback: fixes two cross-cutting regressions (chevron collapse, dataset bleed), reorganizes the menubar and sidebar into a full 8-section navigation control with 3-state toggles, introduces ViewZipper for auto-cycling view transitions, adds a self-reflecting Catalog that renders the internal dataset registry through the same PAFV view engine, fixes SuperGrid display/depth/row-header issues, adds DB Utilities for card creation verification, and ships three full named design themes (NeXTSTEP, Modern, Material).

Canonical refs:
- `docs/UAT-HANDOFF-DesignWorkbench.md` — UAT field notes translated to implementation spec

#### Phase 85: Bug Fixes (A1 Chevron Collapse + A2 Dataset Eviction)
**Goal:** Fix CollapsibleSection collapse binding so chevrons actually hide/show content, and fix dataset eviction so loading a new dataset via Command-K fully evicts prior data from all views, resets SchemaProvider introspection, and clears ProjectionExplorer axes.
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete
Reqs: CHEV-01..05, EVIC-01..05

Plans:
- [ ] 85-01-PLAN.md — Fix CSS specificity for CollapsibleSection collapse
- [ ] 85-02-PLAN.md — Dataset eviction pipeline + zero-bleed tests

#### Phase 86: Shell Restructure (Menubar + Sidebar)
**Goal:** Center "Isometry" wordmark in menubar, enlarge settings icon, remove ViewSwitcher from menubar. Restructure sidebar to 8 top-level sections with 3-state toggle (hidden/visible/collapsed), sub-items as leaf launchers with active state highlighting. GRAPH Explorers, Formula Explorer, and Interface Builder are navigation stubs with placeholder panels.
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete
Reqs: MENU-01..04, SIDE-01..05

Plans:
- [ ] 86-01-PLAN.md — Menubar restructure + shell two-column layout
- [ ] 86-02-PLAN.md — Sidebar navigation component + wiring

#### Phase 87: ViewZipper
**Goal:** Move ViewSwitcher from menubar into Visualization Explorer as ViewZipper. 9 view-type tabs with active state. Play/Stop auto-cycle with crossfade transitions (~2s hold per view). Position-morph animation deferred to follow-on phase.
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete
Reqs: VZIP-01..07

Plans:
- [ ] 87-01-PLAN.md — ViewZipper CSS + TypeScript component
- [ ] 87-02-PLAN.md — Shell wiring + auto-cycle integration

#### Phase 88: Data Explorer + Catalog
**Goal:** Build Data Explorer panel with 4 sections (Import/Export, Catalog, Apps, DB Utilities). Create internal datasets registry table auto-populated on import. Catalog renders as SuperGrid bound to datasets table — no bespoke picker widget. Dataset selection triggers eviction path. SuperGrid-only initially; ViewZipper integration deferred.
Reqs: DEXP-01..07
**Plans:** 4/4 plans complete

Plans:
- [ ] 88-01-PLAN.md — Datasets registry table + CatalogWriter extension + Worker handlers
- [ ] 88-02-PLAN.md — DataExplorerPanel UI component + CSS
- [ ] 88-03-PLAN.md — main.ts wiring + Catalog rendering + dataset switch + SampleDataManager
- [ ] 88-04-PLAN.md — Gap closure: active dataset row CSS highlighting (DEXP-07)

#### Phase 89: SuperGrid Fixes
**Goal:** Wire Property Depth control to re-render cards at selected depth. Fix row headers to show full text with ellipsis overflow and drag-resizable width. Show dataset name after Command-K load with brief loading state.
Reqs: SGFX-01..03
**Plans:** 4 plans (3 complete + 1 gap closure)

Plans:
- [ ] 89-01-PLAN.md — Row header ellipsis overflow + drag-resizable width + persistence
- [ ] 89-02-PLAN.md — Property Depth dropdown in PropertiesExplorer
- [ ] 89-03-PLAN.md — CommandBar dataset name subtitle
- [ ] 89-04-PLAN.md — Gap closure: wire depth getter into SuperGrid render path (SGFX-01)

#### Phase 90: Notebook Verification + Themes
**Goal:** Add DB Utilities card count and recent-cards viewer for notebook creation verification. Ship three full named design themes (NeXTSTEP, Modern, Material) with distinct color palettes. Fix theme switching lag.
Reqs: DBUT-01..03, THME-01..04
