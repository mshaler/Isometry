```swift
// Streaming Architecture Mitigation
class StreamingOfficeProcessor {
    private let maxMemoryThreshold: Int = 150_000_000 // 150MB
    private let streamingBuffer: StreamBuffer

    func processLargeFile(_ filePath: String) async throws -> ImportResult {
        // Memory-bounded streaming processing
        let stream = try createFileStream(filePath)
        defer { stream.cleanup() }

        while let chunk = try await stream.nextChunk(size: 10_000_000) { // 10MB chunks
            let processedChunk = try processChunk(chunk)
            try await persistChunk(processedChunk)

            // Memory pressure check
            if MemoryMonitor.current() > maxMemoryThreshold {
                try await releaseBuffers()
            }
        }

        return ImportResult.success(nodeIds: collectCreatedNodes())
    }
}

// Expected Risk Reduction:
// - Memory exhaustion risk: Eliminated (bounded memory usage)
// - Large file processing: Enabled for multi-GB files
// - System stability: Enhanced through resource monitoring
```

**Error Recovery Enhancement:**
```swift
// Advanced Error Recovery Framework

    func importWithRecovery(_ filePath: String) async throws -> ImportResult {
        do {
            // Attempt standard import
            return try await standardImport(filePath)
        } catch ImportError.memoryExhaustion {
            // Fallback to streaming mode
            return try await streamingImport(filePath)
        } catch ImportError.partialCorruption(let recoverableData) {
            // Attempt partial recovery
            return try await partialRecovery(recoverableData)
        } catch ImportError.temporaryResourceConstraint {
            // Retry with exponential backoff
            return try await retryWithBackoff(filePath)
