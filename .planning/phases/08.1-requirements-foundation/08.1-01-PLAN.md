  <action>Create comprehensive Requirements Traceability Matrix mapping all 10 formal requirements (DBVER-01 through UI-03) to their corresponding Swift implementation files. Use research-recommended format with bidirectional traceability including requirement ID, description, implementation files, verification methods, current status, and acceptance criteria coverage. Include verification gap analysis identifying which acceptance criteria need testing in phases 8.2-8.4. Follow industry standard RTM structure from research document with automated verification hooks for future phases.</action>

Compare against GSD methodology patterns and research-recommended verification approaches. Document foundation verification criteria for database version control system, ETL operations management, and content-aware storage. Include integration points between systems, data flow patterns, and architectural compliance verification checklist for phases 8.2-8.4.
