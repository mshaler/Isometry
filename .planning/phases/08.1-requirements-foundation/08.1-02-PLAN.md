  <action>Create Swift Testing framework configuration following research-recommended patterns for database versioning verification. Implement base test structure with @testable import for Isometry module, async testing support for database operations, and verification test patterns for DBVER-01 through UI-03 requirements. Include test isolation mechanisms for production data protection, test database setup/teardown, and verification result reporting structure. Use research code examples as template with modifications for database versioning and ETL operations context. Implement foundation for automated verification that phases 8.2-8.4 can build upon.</action>
