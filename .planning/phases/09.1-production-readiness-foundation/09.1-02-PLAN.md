  <action>Configure comprehensive integration testing framework for production readiness verification by analyzing existing test infrastructure in native/Tests/IsometryTests/ and extending for production verification needs. Design testing framework architecture supporting: App Store compliance automated testing (privacy, accessibility, content guidelines), CloudKit production environment validation testing, performance benchmarking automation with regression detection, beta testing infrastructure validation, cross-system integration testing between verification components. Document testing environment setup procedures including test data management, mock production environments, automated test execution pipelines, and continuous integration hooks. Establish testing protocols for phases 9.2-9.4 with clear verification methodologies aligned with Swift Testing framework and XCTest patterns used in existing codebase.</action>

  <files>.planning/milestones/v2.3-production-readiness/phases/9.1/9.1-BASELINE-METRICS.md</files>
  <action>Establish comprehensive performance baseline metrics and App Store compliance standards for production verification by documenting specific numerical targets from v2.3 requirements: 60fps rendering performance targets, 99.9% CloudKit availability requirements, sub-second sync performance standards, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance thresholds, iOS 17+ privacy requirements, memory usage and battery consumption limits. Create baseline measurement framework including performance benchmarking procedures, compliance verification checklists, automated metric collection methods, regression detection thresholds, and App Store submission readiness criteria. Document measurement methodologies for existing performance validation infrastructure (PerformanceValidator.swift, NotebookPerformanceValidator.swift) and compliance checking systems (AppStoreComplianceVerifier.swift). Establish baseline data collection procedures for phases 9.2-9.4 verification execution.</action>
