<objective>
Establish systematic verification foundation for v2.3 Production Readiness Infrastructure requirements and App Store submission capability.

Purpose: Create comprehensive traceability between 14 production readiness requirements and Swift implementations, establish verification infrastructure for App Store compliance validation, and prepare integration testing framework for production deployment readiness
Output: Requirements Traceability Matrix, verification infrastructure setup, and foundation for phases 9.2-9.4 systematic verification

  <name>Task 1: Create Production Readiness Requirements Traceability Matrix</name>
  <files>.planning/milestones/v2.3-production-readiness/phases/9.1/9.1-RTM.md</files>
  <action>Create comprehensive Requirements Traceability Matrix mapping all 14 production readiness requirements (COMP-01 through UI-02) to their corresponding Swift implementation files. Use proven v2.2 RTM format with bidirectional traceability including requirement ID, description, implementation files, verification methods, current status, and acceptance criteria coverage. Map production verification files (AppStoreComplianceVerifier.swift, CloudKitProductionVerifier.swift, PerformanceValidator.swift, etc.) and beta testing files (BetaTestingManager.swift, etc.) to their respective requirements. Include verification gap analysis identifying which acceptance criteria need testing in phases 9.2-9.4. Follow industry standard RTM structure with automated verification hooks for App Store compliance checking, CloudKit production validation, and beta testing workflows.</action>
  <verify>RTM.md exists with structured table mapping all 14 requirements to 14 Swift files, includes verification status and App Store compliance coverage analysis</verify>
  <done>Requirements Traceability Matrix provides complete mapping between production readiness requirements and implementations with clear verification gaps identified for App Store submission readiness</done>

  <action>Establish verification infrastructure for production readiness validation by analyzing existing Swift implementation files in native/Sources/Isometry/ProductionVerification/ and Beta/ directories. Document architectural patterns for App Store compliance verification, CloudKit production validation, performance benchmarking, and beta testing infrastructure. Analyze integration points between verification systems (compliance → performance → CloudKit → beta testing) and cross-system dependencies. Create verification infrastructure setup guide including: App Store compliance testing environment configuration, CloudKit production container verification setup, performance benchmarking baseline establishment, beta testing infrastructure validation, and integration testing framework preparation. Include architectural compliance verification checklist aligned with App Store submission requirements and production deployment standards.</action>
