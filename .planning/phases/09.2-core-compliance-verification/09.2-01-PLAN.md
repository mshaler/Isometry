# Phase 09.2 Plan 01: Core App Store Compliance Verification

## Objective

Execute systematic verification of core App Store compliance requirements (COMP-01 through COMP-04) using the production verification infrastructure established in Phase 9.1. Validate privacy policy compliance, accessibility standards, content guidelines, and technical requirements to ensure App Store submission readiness.

## Context Files

@.planning/milestones/v2.3-production-readiness/REQUIREMENTS.md - Core requirements mapping for COMP-01 through COMP-04
@.planning/milestones/v2.3-production-readiness/phases/9.1/9.1-TESTING-FRAMEWORK.md - Verification infrastructure established in Phase 9.1
@native/Sources/Isometry/Verification/AppStoreComplianceVerifier.swift - Implementation to verify

## Tasks

### Task 1: Privacy Policy Compliance Verification (COMP-01)
**Type:** auto

### Task 3: Content Guidelines and Technical Requirements Verification (COMP-03, COMP-04)
**Type:** auto
**TDD:** false

Verify content guidelines compliance and validate all technical requirements for App Store submission.

**Implementation:**
- Test content policy compliance checking mechanisms
- Validate user-generated content moderation
- Verify age-appropriate content classification
- Test harmful content detection systems
- Validate app stability requirements
- Verify performance benchmark compliance
- Test memory usage limits validation
- Confirm launch time requirements testing

**Verification:**
