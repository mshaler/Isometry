  <action>
    Create comprehensive bidirectional requirements traceability matrix following the proven v2.2/v2.5 pattern:

    **Requirements Coverage Analysis:**
    - Map all 11 requirements (CONNECT-01 through PERF-02) to specific Swift files
    - Establish verification phases for each requirement cluster
    - Define acceptance criteria and success metrics for each requirement
    - Create functional requirement → implementation file → verification phase mapping

    **Bidirectional Traceability Structure:**
    - Business Requirements → Functional Requirements → Implementation Files → Verification Phases
    - Include compliance targets (80%+ suggestion accuracy, 90%+ cache hit rate, 100K+ node support)
    - Map CardBoard v1/v2 research integration points
    - Define quantifiable verification criteria for each requirement

    **Implementation File Analysis:**
    - ConnectionSuggestionEngine.swift: 6 suggestion algorithms, batch processing, analytics (516 lines)
    - QueryCache.swift: Actor-based caching, TTL management, performance monitoring (443 lines)
    - Cross-reference with actual implementation capabilities and features
    - Document advanced capabilities beyond basic requirements

    **Risk Assessment:**
    - Algorithm performance impact on system responsiveness
    - Memory consumption for large graph processing
    - Cache coherency for distributed scenarios
    - Machine learning model accuracy dependencies

    Include comprehensive tables mapping requirements to files, verification criteria, and success metrics.

  <action>
    Perform comprehensive architecture verification of graph analytics implementation following GSD analysis methodology:

    **Implementation Analysis:**
    - Analyze ConnectionSuggestionEngine.swift: 6 suggestion types, SQL-based graph queries, confidence scoring
    - Analyze QueryCache.swift: Thread-safe actor design, LRU eviction, automatic cleanup, statistics
    - Document advanced patterns: Swift actors, async/await, Sendable compliance, GRDB integration
    - Assess CardBoard v1/v2 research integration points and algorithm sophistication

    **Production Readiness Assessment:**
    - Performance capabilities: Sub-second response times, 100K+ node support, memory efficiency
    - Scalability patterns: Batch processing, background computation, resource management
    - Reliability features: Error handling, cache coherency, automatic recovery
    - Monitoring capabilities: Performance metrics, cache statistics, analytics reporting

    **Technical Excellence Scoring:**
    - Code quality: Swift best practices, actor safety, error handling patterns
    - Architecture patterns: Clean separation of concerns, dependency injection, testability
    - Performance optimization: Query optimization, memory management, caching strategies
    - Integration design: Database layer abstraction, async operation patterns

    **Gap Analysis:**
    - Compare implementation capabilities against requirements
    - Identify any missing functionality or performance targets
    - Document areas requiring verification focus in subsequent phases
    - Assess enterprise-grade deployment readiness

    Include detailed analysis with specific code examples and performance projections.
