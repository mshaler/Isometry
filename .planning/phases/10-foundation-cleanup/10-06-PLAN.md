<objective>
Validate complete production build pipeline and confirm absolute zero lint goal achievement after gap closure

Purpose: Verify all gaps are closed and production build works end-to-end with zero lint violations
Output: Successful production build with comprehensive validation of absolute zero lint target

<task type="auto">
  <name>Execute comprehensive build validation</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Run complete build pipeline validation to ensure all gaps are closed and production build succeeds.

    Validation sequence:
    1. Clean any existing build artifacts: rm -rf dist/
    2. Run ESLint validation: npm run lint (expect ✖ 0 problems)
    3. Run TypeScript strict compilation: npx tsc --noEmit --strict
    4. Execute production build: npm run build
    5. Verify build artifacts exist: ls dist/ (expect index.html, assets/)
    6. Check final lint status: npm run lint (confirm still 0 problems)

    Success criteria for each step:
    - ESLint: ✖ 0 problems (0 errors, 0 warnings)
    - TypeScript: Found 0 errors
    - Build: Successful tsc && vite build completion
    - Artifacts: dist/ directory with production files
    - Post-build: Maintained zero lint problems

    Gap closure validation: All three verification gaps should now be resolved.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build && npm run lint | grep "✖ 0 problems"</verify>
  <done>Production build completes successfully with zero ESLint problems maintained</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Document Phase 10 completion status</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Create comprehensive completion report documenting Phase 10 Foundation Cleanup achievement of absolute zero lint goal.

    Report should include:
    - Final ESLint status: 0 problems (vs initial 205 warnings)
    - TypeScript strict mode: Enabled with full compliance
    - Production build: Functional tsc && vite build pipeline
    - Regression resolution: 15 problem regression completely fixed
    - Requirements satisfaction: FOUND-01, FOUND-02 fully achieved

    Key achievements to document:
    - ESLint regression (Plans 10-04): Parser.cjs exclusion, test config fixes, unused imports removed
    - TypeScript strict mode (Plan 10-05): D3 type safety, SyncEvent unification, WebView bridge constraints
    - Production pipeline (Plan 10-06): End-to-end build validation successful

    This completes the absolute zero lint target for Phase 10 and enables progression to Phase 11 Type Safety Migration.

  <verify>cat > phase_completion_report.md && echo "Phase 10 completion documented"</verify>
  <done>Phase 10 Foundation Cleanup completion documented with zero lint achievement confirmed</done>

Final Phase 10 validation:
- `npm run lint` returns "✖ 0 problems (0 errors, 0 warnings)"
- `npm run build` completes successfully
- `ls dist/` shows production artifacts
- All verification gaps from 10-VERIFICATION.md resolved
- Phase 10 absolute zero lint goal achieved
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Phase 10 Foundation Cleanup completed successfully:
1. All 3 verification gaps completely closed
2. ESLint regression fixed (15 → 0 problems)
3. TypeScript strict mode fully compliant
4. Production build pipeline functional
5. Absolute zero lint target achieved (205 → 0 warnings total)
6. Ready for Phase 11 Type Safety Migration
</success_criteria>
