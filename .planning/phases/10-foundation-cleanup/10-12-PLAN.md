<objective>
Validate complete achievement of Phase 10 Foundation Cleanup goal through comprehensive verification of absolute zero lint problems and TypeScript strict mode success.

Purpose: Provide definitive proof that all Phase 10 gaps have been closed and the "absolute zero lint problems" goal is achieved, enabling confident progression to Phase 11.
Output: Complete verification report showing 100% Phase 10 goal achievement with quantifiable metrics.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Execute comprehensive foundation cleanup validation</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Run complete validation suite to verify Phase 10 gap closure success:

    1. ESLint Validation:
       - Run: npm run lint
       - Verify exact output: "✖ 0 problems (0 errors, 0 warnings)"
       - Document improvement metrics vs verification baseline

    2. TypeScript Strict Mode Validation:
       - Run: npx tsc --noEmit --strict
       - Verify zero compilation errors (exit code 0)
       - Test across all source files including demo components

    3. Explicit Any Type Validation:
       - Run: npm run lint | grep "no-explicit-any"
       - Verify zero matches (complete elimination)
       - Compare against 37→10→0 progression

    4. Production Build Validation:
       - Run: npm run build
       - Verify successful completion with no warnings
       - Check build artifacts are properly generated

    Generate quantitative success metrics showing complete gap closure.

  <what-built>Complete Phase 10 Foundation Cleanup with absolute zero lint problems achieved</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    Verify the foundation cleanup results:

    1. **Zero Lint Problems**: Run `npm run lint` and confirm output shows "✖ 0 problems (0 errors, 0 warnings)"

    2. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit --strict` and confirm no compilation errors

    3. **Production Build**: Run `npm run build` and confirm successful completion with clean output

    4. **Progress Metrics**: Compare against verification baseline:
       - ESLint problems: 52 → 0 (100% elimination)
       - Explicit any types: 37 → 0 (100% elimination)
       - TypeScript strict errors: hundreds → 0 (complete resolution)

    5. **Application Functionality**: Run `npm run dev` and confirm the application still loads and functions normally

    Expected: Clean development environment with zero technical debt from lint violations or type errors, ready for Phase 11 Type Safety Migration.

  <name>Task 2: Generate Phase 10 completion report and update project state</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Document complete Phase 10 Foundation Cleanup achievement:

    1. Generate comprehensive completion report with:
       - Before/after metrics showing 100% improvement
       - All 3 gaps successfully closed (ESLint, TypeScript, explicit any)
       - Verification evidence from all validation commands
       - Performance impact assessment

    2. Update .planning/STATE.md to reflect Phase 10 complete status
       - Move Phase 10 from "current" to "completed"
       - Update current position to ready for Phase 11
       - Document foundation cleanup achievement

    3. Prepare Phase 11 Type Safety Migration readiness statement:
       - Clean TypeScript foundation established
       - Zero technical debt from lint violations
       - Strict mode compilation working
       - Production build pipeline verified

    Document the successful transition from cleanup to proactive type safety migration.
