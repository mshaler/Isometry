<objective>
Execute manual verification checklist and document Phase 88 completion.

Purpose: Confirm that all three success criteria are TRUE via human verification, not just automated tests. Create verification artifact documenting phase completion.

Output: VERIFICATION.md documenting manual test results and success criteria status.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Run full test suite and document results</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/88-integration-polish/88-VERIFICATION.md</files>
  <action>
Run the full test suite and document results in VERIFICATION.md.

Steps:
1. Run `npm run test --run` and capture pass/fail count
2. Run `npm run typecheck` and verify clean
3. Document any failing tests and their status

Create initial VERIFICATION.md structure:
```markdown
# Phase 88: Integration & Polish - Verification

## Automated Test Results

**Date:** [today]
**Test Command:** `npm run test --run`

### Results
- Total tests: [count]
- Passing: [count]
- Failing: [count]

### New Integration Tests (from 88-01, 88-02)
- ShellComponent.integration.test.tsx: [pass/fail]
- shell-tab-integration.test.ts: [pass/fail]
- cross-tab-integration.test.ts: [pass/fail]

## Manual Verification Checklist

[To be completed in Task 2]

## Success Criteria Status

[To be completed after checkpoint]

  <how-to-verify>
**Manual Verification Steps:**

1. **Tab State Preservation (Success Criterion 1)**
   - Start dev server: `npm run dev`
   - Open Shell in browser
   - Terminal tab: Type a command (e.g., `echo test`), see output
   - Switch to Claude AI tab
   - Switch back to Terminal tab
   - **VERIFY:** Previous output still visible, terminal responsive
   - Switch to GSD tab, verify phase display loads
   - Switch back to Claude AI
   - **VERIFY:** Any conversation messages still present

2. **Terminal Output Accessibility (Success Criterion 2)**
   - Run a command in Terminal that produces output
   - Note: Full "save as card" UX is not implemented
   - **VERIFY:** Terminal output is displayed and scrollable
   - (Future: This would be passed to Claude AI context)

3. **GSD Terminal Integration (Success Criterion 3)**
   - With Terminal tab active, the GSD tab should still receive updates
   - Modify a .planning/phases/*-PLAN.md file externally
   - Switch to GSD tab
   - **VERIFY:** GSD progress display reflects current state
   - **VERIFY:** No errors in console about missed updates

4. **Rapid Tab Switching**
   - Click between tabs rapidly 10+ times
   - **VERIFY:** No crashes, no visual glitches, state preserved

**Expected Results:**
- All tab switches preserve state
- No console errors during tab switches
- Terminal PTY remains connected across switches

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Complete VERIFICATION.md with checkpoint results</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/88-integration-polish/88-VERIFICATION.md</files>
  <action>
Update VERIFICATION.md with checkpoint results and success criteria status.

Add sections:
```markdown
## Manual Verification Results

**Verified by:** [user confirmation from checkpoint]
**Date:** [today]

### Tab State Preservation
- Terminal→Claude AI→Terminal: [PASS/FAIL]
- Claude AI→GSD→Claude AI: [PASS/FAIL]
- GSD→Terminal→GSD: [PASS/FAIL]
- Rapid switching (10x): [PASS/FAIL]

### Cross-Tab Data Flow
- Terminal output accessible: [PASS/FAIL]
- GSD receives updates regardless of active tab: [PASS/FAIL]

### Issues Found
[List any issues from checkpoint, or "None"]

## Success Criteria Status

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1. Tab switching without state loss | [TRUE/FALSE] | Manual verification + integration tests |
| 2. Terminal output accessible | [TRUE/FALSE] | Manual verification (full save-as-card UX deferred) |
| 3. GSD triggers correctly | [TRUE/FALSE] | Integration tests + manual verification |

## Phase 88 Conclusion

**Status:** [COMPLETE/NEEDS_WORK]
**Summary:** [One line summary]
```

If all criteria are TRUE, mark phase complete.
If issues found, document them and note follow-up needed.

After completing all tasks:
1. 88-VERIFICATION.md exists with all sections populated
2. Success criteria table shows status for each criterion
3. Phase conclusion is documented
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] Manual verification checkpoint completed
- [ ] All three success criteria evaluated (TRUE or documented blockers)
- [ ] 88-VERIFICATION.md committed to repository
- [ ] Phase 88 status updated in STATE.md and ROADMAP.md
