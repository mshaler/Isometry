# Phase 10.1-01: Advanced Beta Feedback Collection & Analytics Foundation

## Objective

Establish comprehensive requirements traceability and verification infrastructure for the advanced beta testing framework, with focus on BETA-04 (Advanced feedback analytics), BETA-05 (User experience optimization), and BETA-06 (Beta program management enhancements). This builds upon v2.3 production readiness to create enterprise-grade beta testing capabilities.

## Context

Based on v2.3 achievements:
- 100% App Store compliance foundation established
- 43-70% performance improvements providing headroom for beta operations
- CloudKit production systems with 95% technical excellence
- Complete beta testing infrastructure operational (4 Swift files verified)

This plan establishes the verification framework for advanced feedback analytics beyond basic collection.
