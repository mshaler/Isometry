<objective>
Conduct comprehensive import pipeline management and data quality validation analysis for IMPORT-02 and IMPORT-03 requirements verification

Purpose: Verify import pipeline management provides job scheduling/prioritization, resource management/memory optimization, cancellation/cleanup procedures, validation/quality assurance, and analytics/performance monitoring. Validate data quality systems deliver integrity checking, duplicate detection/deduplication, quality scoring/reporting, success rate tracking, and verification/rollback capabilities.

Output: Complete pipeline management analysis with enterprise scalability assessment and comprehensive data quality validation framework establishing production-ready import infrastructure for v2.5 milestone completion
