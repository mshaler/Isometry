    - Real-time suggestion updates with visual confidence indicators

    Connection Suggestion Visualization:
    - Suggested connections rendered as dashed lines with confidence-based styling
    - Connection suggestion confidence visualization: opacity (0.3-0.9), line width (1-4px)
    - Interactive suggestion acceptance: click to apply with confirmation dialog
    - Suggestion type indicators: color coding (content=blue, community=green, temporal=orange)
    - Hover tooltips showing suggestion reason, confidence score, and acceptance recommendation

    Advanced Analytics Integration:
    - Graph density visualization with real-time metrics overlay
    - Node importance indicators based on centrality and connection strength
    - Community detection visualization with color-coded clusters
    - Path analysis with shortest path highlighting between selected nodes

    Performance Enhancement Features:
    - LOD integration for large graphs: detailed view <100 nodes, simplified view >1000 nodes
    - Viewport culling integration leveraging Phase 14.3 optimization pipeline
    - Smart suggestion loading: visible nodes first, off-screen suggestions on demand
    - Memory optimization: suggestion cleanup when nodes leave viewport

    User Interaction Enhancement:
    - Suggestion acceptance tracking with analytics feedback to native engine
    - Suggestion confidence threshold adjustment with real-time preview
    - Suggestion type filtering with multi-select interface (content, community, temporal, semantic)
    - Connection suggestion history with undo/redo capability

    Integration with Phase 14.1-14.3:
    - PAFV coordinate transformation integration for suggestion positioning
    - LATCH filtering integration: suggestions respect active filters
    - D3-Canvas performance optimization integration for smooth interactions
    - Consistent styling with existing theme system and performance patterns

    1. Open the enhanced NetworkView in browser
    2. Load a graph dataset with multiple nodes and edges
    3. Click on a node to see connection suggestions appear as dashed lines
    4. Verify suggestion confidence is visualized through opacity/line width
    5. Test suggestion acceptance by clicking suggested connections
    6. Confirm suggestion type filtering works (content, community, temporal)
    7. Validate performance with large datasets (>100 nodes)
    8. Check suggestion tooltips show reason and confidence scores
    9. Test viewport culling: suggestions only computed for visible nodes
    10. Verify integration with existing theme system and Phase 14.3 optimizations
