    Develop integration testing protocols for end-to-end import workflow validation:

    1. Cross-System Integration Tests:
       - Office → Isometry graph: Document structure → node hierarchy transformation
       - SQLite → Isometry: Relational data → graph edge mapping validation
       - Apple ecosystem → Real-time sync: Bi-directional synchronization testing

    2. Workflow Integration Tests:
       - Multi-format import: Sequential Office, SQLite, Apple data import validation
       - Concurrent import operations: Multiple simultaneous import job management
       - Import pipeline: Queue management, progress aggregation, error handling

    3. Performance Integration Tests:
       - Large dataset handling: 100MB+ Office documents, million-record SQLite databases
       - Memory stress testing: Concurrent imports with memory constraints
       - Real-time responsiveness: UI updates during long-running import operations

    4. Error Handling Integration Tests:
       - Partial failure recovery: Import job interruption and resumption
       - Corrupt data handling: Invalid file format and malformed data processing
       - Resource exhaustion: Low memory, storage space, and network conditions

    5. User Experience Integration Tests:
       - Progress reporting accuracy: Real-time import progress visualization
       - Cancel/retry workflows: User-initiated import management operations
       - Error reporting: Clear user guidance for import failures and recovery

    Include test scenarios, expected outcomes, and automated validation procedures.
