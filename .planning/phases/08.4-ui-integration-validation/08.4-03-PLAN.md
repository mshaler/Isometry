  <action>
    Execute comprehensive end-to-end workflow scenarios across all verified UI components and document integration quality:

    **Complex Database Versioning Workflows:**
    - Scenario 1: Create analytics branch → Configure ETL operation → Execute analysis → Merge results back to main
    - Scenario 2: Create synthetic data branch → Generate test dataset → Run validation ETL → Cleanup synthetic branch
    - Scenario 3: Handle merge conflicts during analytics branch integration with concurrent main branch changes
    - Scenario 4: Rollback failed ETL operation affecting database version state

    **Multi-Component ETL Workflow Integration:**
    - Scenario 5: Template selection → Operation configuration → Progress monitoring → Result analysis → Catalog update
    - Scenario 6: Complex multi-step ETL pipeline with intermediate results and branching logic
    - Scenario 7: ETL operation failure handling with proper rollback and user notification
    - Scenario 8: Concurrent ETL operations with resource management and queue coordination

    **Cross-System Integration Scenarios:**
    - Scenario 9: Database version control → ETL operation → Data catalog update → CloudKit sync propagation
    - Scenario 10: ETL data catalog search → Source selection → Operation builder → Version control integration
    - Scenario 11: Real-time collaboration with multiple users on shared database branches
    - Scenario 12: Error recovery across multiple system components with proper state restoration

    **Performance and Scalability Testing:**
    - Test workflows with large datasets (1000+ nodes, 100MB+ data)
    - Verify UI responsiveness during intensive database operations
    - Document memory usage patterns during complex multi-step workflows
    - Test concurrent user scenarios with shared resources

    **Error Scenario Integration Testing:**
    - Network connectivity loss during CloudKit sync operations
    - Database transaction failures during version control operations
    - ETL operation timeout and cancellation handling
    - UI state corruption recovery and user session restoration

    **Navigation and State Management Integration:**
    - Verify navigation flow preservation during complex workflows
    - Test deep linking and workflow resumption after app backgrounding
    - Document state persistence across app sessions and device restarts
    - Analyze navigation stack integrity during multi-modal workflows

    For each scenario, document:
    - Step-by-step workflow execution
    - UI component coordination and data flow
    - Error handling and recovery mechanisms
    - Performance metrics and user experience quality
    - Integration points between database, ETL, and UI layers

    Use integration scoring methodology:
    - Workflow Completion Success Rate (30%)
    - Component Coordination Quality (25%)
    - Error Handling Effectiveness (25%)
    - Performance During Integration (20%)

    Focus on production-realistic scenarios with emphasis on system reliability and user experience quality.
