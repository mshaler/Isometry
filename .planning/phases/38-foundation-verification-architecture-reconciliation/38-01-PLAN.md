<objective>
Create comprehensive Phase 34 VERIFICATION.md using Requirements Traceability Matrix methodology to systematically verify all 9 foundation requirements (FOUND-01 through INTEG-05) have been properly implemented.

Purpose: Address missing verification for Phase 34 "Foundation Stabilization" which is marked complete but has no verification artifacts. This gap blocks accurate milestone closure assessment.
Output: Evidence-based verification documentation proving Phase 34 requirements are implemented and working.

  <name>Requirements Verification Analysis</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/34-foundation-stabilization/34-VERIFICATION.md</files>
  <action>
    Create comprehensive VERIFICATION.md using RTM methodology from research patterns.

    For each requirement (FOUND-01, FOUND-02, FOUND-03, FOUND-04, INTEG-01, INTEG-02, INTEG-03, INTEG-04, INTEG-05):

    1. Map requirement to actual implementation files and line numbers
    2. Decompose acceptance criteria into verifiable evidence points
    3. Test requirement behavior where possible (D3.js data binding, sql.js queries, TypeScript compilation)
    4. Document implementation status: COMPLETE/PARTIAL/MISSING with evidence
    5. Mark verification status: VERIFIED/PENDING/FAILED

    Structure per research:
    ```
    #### FOUND-01: Basic Grid Cells with D3.js Data Binding
    - **Implementation File:** src/d3/SuperGrid.ts
    - **Implementation Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
    - **Verification Status:** ✅ VERIFIED

    **Implementation Mapping:**
    - **Methods:** renderCards() at lines X-Y
    - **Key Functions:** d => d.id pattern verified at line Z
    - **Performance:** 60fps target via virtual scrolling

    **Acceptance Criteria → Implementation Evidence:**
    - [x] D3.js data binding → .join() with key functions verified at line X
    - [x] Key function performance → proper key pattern d => d.id at line Y
    - [x] Basic grid cells → card rendering implementation at line Z

    **Verification Evidence:**
    - Code inspection: SuperGrid.renderCards() implements D3 .join() pattern
    - Test verification: Data binding works in SuperGridDemo
    - Performance: Virtual scrolling handles 10k+ cells
    ```

    Include bidirectional traceability - each implementation file should trace back to requirements it satisfies.

    Focus on evidence-based verification - what can actually be observed working, not assumptions.
  </action>
  <verify>grep -c "✅ VERIFIED" .planning/phases/34-foundation-stabilization/34-VERIFICATION.md should return 9 (one per requirement)</verify>
  <done>Complete RTM with all 9 Phase 34 requirements systematically verified with implementation evidence and acceptance criteria validation</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Update Requirements Traceability</name>
  <files>.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md</files>
  <action>
    Update the Traceability section of REQUIREMENTS.md based on verification findings from 34-VERIFICATION.md.

    For each verified requirement:
    1. Change Status from "Pending" to "Complete" or "Partial" based on verification evidence
    2. Add verification date and evidence summary

    Update the status column for these requirements:
    - FOUND-01 | Phase 34 | Complete (if verified)
    - FOUND-02 | Phase 34 | Complete (if verified)
    - FOUND-03 | Phase 34 | Complete (if verified)
    - FOUND-04 | Phase 34 | Complete (if verified)
    - INTEG-01 | Phase 34 | Complete (if verified)
    - INTEG-02 | Phase 34 | Complete (if verified)
    - INTEG-03 | Phase 34 | Complete (if verified)
    - INTEG-04 | Phase 34 | Complete (if verified)
    - INTEG-05 | Phase 34 | Complete (if verified)

    Add verification metadata at the bottom:
    ```
    **Verification Status:**
    - Phase 34 requirements verified: 2026-02-07
    - Verification method: Requirements Traceability Matrix with evidence-based validation
    - Verification artifacts: .planning/phases/34-foundation-stabilization/34-VERIFICATION.md
    ```

    Maintain exact formatting and structure of existing traceability table.
  </action>
  <verify>grep "Complete" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md | wc -l should show updated count reflecting verified requirements</verify>
  <done>REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table accurately reflects Phase 34 verification status with evidence-based updates</done>
</task>
