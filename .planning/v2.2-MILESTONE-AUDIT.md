**Critical Gap:** UI requirements cannot be verified

**Missing Deliverables:**
- SwiftUI interface verification for UI-01, UI-02, UI-03
- Real-time synchronization validation
- Cross-platform consistency confirmation
- End-to-end workflow integration testing

**Impact:** Blocks milestone completion and user access to v2.2 features

## Cross-Phase Integration Analysis

### Connected Systems ✅

**Backend Actor Integration:** Excellent
- DatabaseVersionControl ↔ UI components via reactive binding
- ETLOperationManager ↔ ETL UI components with proper state management
- ContentAwareStorageManager ↔ ETL operations via actor integration
- Cross-system coordination via dedicated integration actors

**Data Flow:** Complete
- Actor state changes → ObservableObject publishing → UI automatic updates
- Cross-system data sharing via Codable/Sendable models
- Version control ↔ ETL integration via `ETLVersionControlIntegration.swift`

### Critical Integration Gaps ❌

**Main App Navigation:** BROKEN
- **Issue:** UI components exist but not integrated into `ContentView.swift`
- **Impact:** Users cannot access any v2.2 features
- **Evidence:** No navigation paths from main app to version control/ETL features

**User Access Flows:** BROKEN
- Database versioning features: Backend complete, UI created, navigation missing
- ETL operations workflow: Full implementation, zero user access
- Data catalog: Functional implementation, inaccessible from main app

### Orphaned Components ⚠️

**UI Components:** Created but unused
- `ETLVersionHistoryView.swift` - exists but not imported by main app
- Performance monitoring APIs - available but no UI display

**Performance Metrics:** Available but hidden
- Backend metrics collection operational
- No UI components consuming performance data

## End-to-End Flow Analysis

### Complete Flows ✅

1. **Backend Actor Coordination**
   - Status: COMPLETE
   - Flow: Actor creation → State management → Cross-system integration
   - Quality: Excellent architectural patterns

2. **SwiftUI State Management**
