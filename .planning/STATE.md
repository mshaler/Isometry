# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-05)

**Core value:** Transform the Isometry ecosystem with a capture-shell-preview workflow that bridges rapid note-taking with AI-assisted development, seamlessly integrating notebook cards into the existing PAFV+LATCH+GRAPH knowledge system.
**Current focus:** Phase 34 Foundation Stabilization

## Current Position

Phase: 34 of 37 (Foundation Stabilization)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-06 — Completed 34-01 Foundation Stabilization TypeScript + sql.js

Progress: [███▓░░░░░░] 28% (34-01 foundation complete, 34-02 ready)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 86+ (across all previous milestones)
- Average duration: TBD (v4.1 milestone starting)
- Total execution time: TBD

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 33 (v4.0) | 3/3 | Complete | Foundation established |
| 34 (v4.1) | 1/3 | In progress | ~10 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- v4.0 Phase 33: Bridge elimination foundation completed successfully
- v4.1 Phase 34-01: TypeScript + sql.js foundation stabilized with FTS5 support
- Trend: SuperGrid implementation ready with clean type safety

*Updated after 34-01 completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 33: Bridge elimination architecture chosen (sql.js direct access vs 40KB MessageBridge)
- v4.1: SuperGrid Foundation prioritized as keystone feature for polymorphic data projection
- Research: Four-phase approach validated (Foundation → PAFV Core → Headers → Continuum)
- 34-01: sql.js-fts5 package chosen over CDN sql.js for FTS5 support and local asset strategy
- 34-01: Comprehensive error telemetry implemented for future Claude Code integration

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None. Clean TypeScript compilation achieved with sql.js-fts5 FTS5 support verified. Ready for SuperGrid PAFV core implementation.
