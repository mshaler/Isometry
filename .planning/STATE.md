# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-05)

**Core value:** Transform the Isometry ecosystem with a capture-shell-preview workflow that bridges rapid note-taking with AI-assisted development, seamlessly integrating notebook cards into the existing PAFV+LATCH+GRAPH knowledge system.
**Current focus:** Phase 34 Foundation Stabilization

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 33: Bridge elimination architecture chosen (sql.js direct access vs 40KB MessageBridge)
- v4.1: SuperGrid Foundation prioritized as keystone feature for polymorphic data projection
- Research: Four-phase approach validated (Foundation → PAFV Core → Headers → Continuum)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet. v4.0 Bridge Elimination Foundation provides clean sql.js + D3.js architecture for SuperGrid development.
