# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All TypeScript architectural decisions locked (D-001..D-010). Full logs in PROJECT.md.
v5.2 decisions archived to PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

### Blockers/Concerns

- CSS content-visibility: auto requires Safari 18+ (iOS 18+) -- iOS 17 users get JS windowing only
- FeatureGate bypassed in DEBUG builds -- test tier gates before release

## Session Continuity
