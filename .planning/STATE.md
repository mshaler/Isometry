# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-05)

**Core value:** Transform the Isometry ecosystem with a capture-shell-preview workflow that bridges rapid note-taking with AI-assisted development, seamlessly integrating notebook cards into the existing PAFV+LATCH+GRAPH knowledge system.
**Current focus:** Phase 35 PAFV Grid Core (Ready to start)

## Current Position

Phase: 36 of 37 (SuperGrid Headers) 🟡 IN PROGRESS
Plan: 3 of 4 in current phase ✅ COMPLETE
Status: Plan 36-03 SuperGridZoom Integration (Gap Closure) completed successfully
Last activity: 2026-02-07 — Completed 36-03-PLAN.md with zoom/pan UI controls and state persistence

Progress: [████████▓▓] 87% (Phase 36 Plans 1-3 complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 86+ (across all previous milestones)
- Average duration: TBD (v4.1 milestone starting)
- Total execution time: TBD

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 33 (v4.0) | 3/3 | Complete | Foundation established |
| 34 (v4.1) | 3/3 | ✅ COMPLETE | SuperGrid foundation stable |
| 35 (v4.1) | 4/4 | ✅ COMPLETE | Interactive header filtering (3.37 mins avg) |
| 36 (v4.1) | 3/4 | 🟡 IN PROGRESS | Hierarchical headers + Janus controls (13.3 mins avg) |

**Recent Trend:**
- v4.0 Phase 33: Bridge elimination foundation completed successfully
- v4.1 Phase 34-01: TypeScript + sql.js foundation stabilized with FTS5 support
- v4.1 Phase 34-02: Janus density grid cells with virtual scrolling implemented

- v4.1 Phase 35-01: Card detail modal with full CRUD operations ✅
- v4.1 Phase 35-02: Header click LATCH filtering with comprehensive UI ✅
- v4.1 Phase 35-03: Multi-select and keyboard navigation with bulk operations ✅
- v4.1 Phase 35-05: Interactive header filtering with LATCH filter service integration ✅
- v4.1 Phase 36-01: Hierarchical header foundation with d3-hierarchy, hybrid span calculation, progressive rendering ✅
- v4.1 Phase 36-02: Janus orthogonal zoom/pan controls, morphing boundary animations, state persistence ✅
- v4.1 Phase 36-03: SuperGridZoom integration with UI controls and localStorage state persistence ✅
- Trend: Phase 36 SuperGrid Headers advancing with working zoom/pan controls and gap closure

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 33: Bridge elimination architecture chosen (sql.js direct access vs 40KB MessageBridge)
- v4.1: SuperGrid Foundation prioritized as keystone feature for polymorphic data projection
- Research: Four-phase approach validated (Foundation → PAFV Core → Headers → Continuum)
- 34-01: sql.js-fts5 package chosen over CDN sql.js for FTS5 support and local asset strategy
- 34-01: Comprehensive error telemetry implemented for future Claude Code integration
- 34-02: Unified CellData structure across all density levels for morphing consistency
- 34-02: Janus orthogonal controls (PanLevel × ZoomLevel) for sophisticated density management
- 34-02: TanStack Virtual integration for 10k+ cell performance vs custom virtualization
- 34-03: Bridge elimination architecture proven working (sql.js → D3.js zero serialization)
- 34-03: SuperGrid foundation stable with LATCH headers and real data visualization
- 36-01: Unlimited nesting depth based on data complexity (vs arbitrary limits)
- 36-01: Hybrid span calculation: data-proportional + content minimums + equal fallback
- 36-01: Geometric click zones: 32px parent label for expand/collapse, remaining body for selection
- 36-01: Content-aware alignment serving scannability over uniformity
- 36-02: Separate zoom/pan controls initially (not combined widget)
- 36-02: Fixed corner anchor for zoom operations (upper-left pinned)
- 36-02: Smooth animation transitions with "quiet app" aesthetic (300ms max)
- 36-02: Per-dataset, per-app state persistence for user context restoration
- 36-03: localStorage demonstration for state persistence (vs immediate database integration)
- 36-03: Separate button groups for zoom/pan with color coding (blue for zoom, green for pan)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None. Phase 36-03 SuperGridZoom Integration complete. SuperGrid now has:
- SuperGridZoom fully integrated with callback system for zoom/pan changes
- UI controls enabling user access to Janus density controls (zoom: leaf vs collapsed, pan: dense vs sparse)
- State persistence via localStorage preserving user settings across sessions
- Zero compilation errors, working zoom/pan with smooth 300ms animations
- All verification gaps from Phase 36 closed with end-to-end functionality

Ready for Phase 36-04 Dynamic Reflow Implementation with axis repositioning.
