## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Key milestone decisions:

- sql.js-fts5 package chosen over CDN sql.js for FTS5 support
- TanStack Virtual integration for 10k+ cell performance
- ViewEngine architecture for unified D3 rendering
- idb package for IndexedDB persistence
- Bridge elimination achieved via sql.js direct access

### Pending Todos

None - milestone complete.

### Blockers/Concerns

**None - Milestone Complete**

**Pre-existing Issues (not blocking):**
- ~40 TypeScript errors in grid-interaction, grid-selection, logging modules (pre-existing)
- Directory health check failing for src/services (22/15 files) - pre-existing cleanup needed

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-10
Stopped at: v4.1 milestone completion and archival
Resume file: N/A (milestone complete)

## Next Steps

Start next milestone with `/gsd:new-milestone`:
- Questioning phase to gather requirements
- Research phase to explore implementation approaches
- Requirements definition for v4.2 Three-Canvas Notebook
- Roadmap creation with phase breakdown

**Recommended:** `/clear` first for fresh context window before starting new milestone.
