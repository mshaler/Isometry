# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-05)

**Core value:** Transform the Isometry ecosystem with a capture-shell-preview workflow that bridges rapid note-taking with AI-assisted development, seamlessly integrating notebook cards into the existing PAFV+LATCH+GRAPH knowledge system.
**Current focus:** Phase 35 PAFV Grid Core (Ready to start)

## Current Position

Phase: 35 of 37 (PAFV Grid Core) 🟡 IN PROGRESS
Plan: 3 of 4 in current phase ✅ COMPLETE
Status: Plan 35-03 Multi-Select and Keyboard Navigation completed successfully
Last activity: 2026-02-07 — Completed 35-03-PLAN.md with comprehensive multi-select functionality

Progress: [███████░░░] 70% (35-03 multi-select complete, Phase 35 in progress)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 86+ (across all previous milestones)
- Average duration: TBD (v4.1 milestone starting)
- Total execution time: TBD

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 33 (v4.0) | 3/3 | Complete | Foundation established |
| 34 (v4.1) | 3/3 | ✅ COMPLETE | SuperGrid foundation stable |
| 35 (v4.1) | 2/4 | 🟡 IN PROGRESS | Header filtering complete (5 mins) |

**Recent Trend:**
- v4.0 Phase 33: Bridge elimination foundation completed successfully
- v4.1 Phase 34-01: TypeScript + sql.js foundation stabilized with FTS5 support
- v4.1 Phase 34-02: Janus density grid cells with virtual scrolling implemented
- v4.1 Phase 34-03: SuperGrid demo working with real data visualization ✅
- v4.1 Phase 35-01: Card detail modal with full CRUD operations ✅
- v4.1 Phase 35-02: Header click LATCH filtering with comprehensive UI ✅
- v4.1 Phase 35-03: Multi-select and keyboard navigation with bulk operations ✅
- Trend: PAFV Grid Core nearing completion, interactive manipulation features fully working

*Updated after Phase 35-03 completion - 2026-02-07*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 33: Bridge elimination architecture chosen (sql.js direct access vs 40KB MessageBridge)
- v4.1: SuperGrid Foundation prioritized as keystone feature for polymorphic data projection
- Research: Four-phase approach validated (Foundation → PAFV Core → Headers → Continuum)
- 34-01: sql.js-fts5 package chosen over CDN sql.js for FTS5 support and local asset strategy
- 34-01: Comprehensive error telemetry implemented for future Claude Code integration
- 34-02: Unified CellData structure across all density levels for morphing consistency
- 34-02: Janus orthogonal controls (PanLevel × ZoomLevel) for sophisticated density management
- 34-02: TanStack Virtual integration for 10k+ cell performance vs custom virtualization
- 34-03: Bridge elimination architecture proven working (sql.js → D3.js zero serialization)
- 34-03: SuperGrid foundation stable with LATCH headers and real data visualization

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None. Phase 34 Foundation Stabilization complete. SuperGrid demo operational with:
- Bridge elimination architecture working (sql.js → D3.js direct binding)
- LATCH headers rendering real database data
- Performance monitoring and error telemetry functional
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- PAFV context integration ready

Ready for Phase 35 PAFV Grid Core implementation.
