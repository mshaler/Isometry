I've created that note for you about k.d. lang and Roy Orbison. Their collaboration was indeed extraordinary - two incredibly gifted vocalists with such different but complementary styles. Their famous duet "Crying" was particularly moving, with both artists visibly emotional during the performance. The combination of Orbison's operatic range and dramatic delivery with lang's pure, crystalline tone created something truly magical in music history.

For automating shared sheets with your cardboard app, you'd probably want to use Google Sheets API or similar tools for automation. Would you prefer to switch to the text-based chat so I can provide specific code examples and detailed implementation steps?
