Cat litter for us, sex for me NEVER?

Peru’s General Óscar Benavides:

“For my friends, everything; for my enemies, the law.”

You can ask me to take care of the cat litter when you want. That is completely reasonable on its own.

But when I NEED sex, I don’t get to ask. You spend more time in Nordstrom Rack than we do having sex. WTF?!?

The obstacles I can easily enumerate are formidable:

Neuropathic anorgasmia

CPRS

ADHD

“Wegovy vulva”

Menopause

Stress

Exhaustion

Hostile work environment

Boredom

Inhibition

Disconnectedness

Resentment

Alex

Money

Antipathy

Frustration

Dysmorphia

Extended family BS

Your other priorities/distractions

Wine

Dizziness/headaches

Global climate change

Autocracy

Despair

Loneliness

Pain

Hopelessness

Emptiness

Jealousy

Max

Impending doom

Mortality

Joylessness

It’s fucking hard to come

Your iPad

If you want to be married to me, my needs must be met. Now.
