CardBoard Notes

CSS: Styling for CardBoard across contexts

* Apple Notes: make Notebook an Apple Notes clone in appearance and behavior (all the keyboard shortcuts/mappings)
* NeXTSTEP: make the grey scale the great scale, possibly to include window chrome for Canvases

3D: Need to add 3D to the SD Continuum:

* SuperGrid 3D: max contextualization
* Mermaid 3D: directionality and directed edges
* Graph 3D: you spin me round right round

* ETL: Add Claude and Mermaid and Three.js
* GitHub: clean up testing runner errors and refactor testing suite (into its own app?)
* Build out CardBoard project Kanban
