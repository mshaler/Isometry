Obsidian vs. Notion

So this was very helpful, and I kept going with more research and I think I have an even better answer than Obsidian.  Here are the two key needs for now:

* Compose/capture/organize Claude Desktop and Claude Code interactions and artifacts
* Track tasks, issues, and progress in a database with kanban view

Instead of Obsidian.md: Notion + TaskMaster.dev [https://www.notion.com/en-gb/templates/claude-task-master](https://www.notion.com/en-gb/templates/claude-task-master)

First, a little context: I actually liked using Notion up until I realized I could make an even better app in CardBoard.  CardBoard’s Card data model (Title, Properties, and Content) is nearly identical to Notion’s (Title, Properties, and Page). Where Notion wins is in collaboration and ecosystem, while where Notion loses is in multidimensionality . Their tables/formulas are generally insufficient for my needs—except in the case of simple projects.  Having a real database with Kanban views and a great writing surface makes Notion the better answer for me than Obsidian.  And adding fuel to the fire, I really find Obsidian to be high friction UX.

Your thoughts here?
