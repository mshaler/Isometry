CardBoard Specification

**At a technical user level, Cardboard is a multidimensional spreadsheet substrate inspired by Lotus Improv with an integrated dynamic kanban overlay**. Cards on a board….:)

**Cards** are the operational foreground layer: Kanban cards with properties

**Boards** are the analytics background layer: a SuperGrid with dynamic category views

CardBoard is an application for organizing ideas, actions, events, people, and connections to optimize work and play for maximum joy/throughput with minimum friction. It can enable data discovery and exploration as a multidimensional spreadsheet or a kanban with swimlanes: “Give me a CSV, and I will help you shape your story.”

## Cardboard use cases

- Replace note/task management apps with an optimized high-velocity user experience

* Write novels and presentations: Markdown kanban cards help build structured narratives
* Make sense of Personal Semantic Index (who/what/where/when/why)
* Manage Playlists for maximal intentionality and clarity
* Organize corporate work: capture and sequence actions in concert with events and values

**Core Architecture Concepts**
**Technology Stack**

| **Component** | **Technology** |

|---|---|

| Backend | CloudKit with graph extensions |

| Front-end | React and D3.js |

| Target platforms | Apple platforms and web browser |

| Formats | Database, .cardboard, CSV, MD, and HTML |

### Multidimensional Data Model

- **Dimensions**: Axes comprising hierarchical categories (e.g., "Product", "Region", "Month")

- **Categories**: Groupings within hierarchical dimensions (e.g., "Laptop", "North", "January")

- **Items**: While sub-categories are typically symmetrical across categories, Items can be added to sub-categories and update sub-category calculations

- **DataCells**: Card positions in the SuperGrid (if not specified, then Gallery view is just cards)

- **Cards**: Rich data containers composed of Titles, Properties, and Content

- **Formulas**: Plain-English formulas targeting Categories, not individual cells, specified by user-selected Properties (with JavaScript scripting support)

- **DataSet**: Main container holding dimensions, items, data, cards, and formulas
**Key Principles**

- **Multidimensionality**: Data is organized by Categories on Dimensions across multiple axes, not just rows/columns and updates across multiple windows/views

- **Dynamic Views**: Categories can be pivoted between Dimensions: Rows, Columns, and Filters

- **Separation of Operations**: Dimensions, Formulas, and Cards are distinct concepts

- **Plain English Formulas**: Apply to entire categories (e.g., Sales = Price 

* Units)

- **Visible agility**: Assign Cards (Notes or Tasks with Titles, Properties, and Content) to DataPoints aligned with Dimensions and Categories 

## Data Features

- CloudKit **and** files are **both** the persistence layer for sync/portability/compatibility

	- CloudKit is augmented by [SQLite graph](https://github.com/dpapathanasiou/simple-graph) extension support for Graph Views and connection editing/navigation

- CardBoard files (JSON specification) and Apple Personal Semantic Index sources are the primary native data types

- High-fidelity automated import/export/round-trip of Apple Notes, which updates Apple Notes—especially Folders and other metadata—based on CardBoard edits

Open/save/import/export filetypes: CSV, HTML, JSON, and MD

- Fast fuzzy indexed search like [https://github.com/emadda/hot-notes](https://github.com/emadda/hot-notes)

- Versioning and deduplication like [https://github.com/germabyte/obsidian-deduper](https://github.com/germabyte/obsidian-deduper)

- Powerful tokenized search, filtering, and data operations (SQL-style commands)

## Views

| **View*

* | **Example*

* |

|---|---|

| SuperGrid | Multidimensional spreadsheet |

| Kanban | Foreground Cards |

| Cards | Tasks and Notes with Title/Properties/Content |

| Graph | Connected Cards |

| Outline | Text-based Hierarchies |

| Time | Events, Daily Notes and WeekMap timelines |

| Space | Maps |

| Capture | Inbound Links/Mail/Slack/Messages/Voice |

| Canvas | Dashboard of views |

## SuperGrid

- SuperGrid views are a multidimensional table that can be snapshotted and added to a canvas, and from there dynamically updated (everything is a matrix of cards)

CSV import for Board Views starts with a simple grid, then adds dynamic dimensions, subtotals, and summaries
* Default formats for imported data are Helvetica/San Francisco/san serif font, left aligned/center aligned/wrap in cell, no colors, all user-configurable
* SuperGrid can also be ungrouped to just rows and columns (CSV in standard spreadsheet grid)
* Need to be able to select/hide/unhide data cells by category and state, such as non-calculated cells and categories for Summarize SuperGrid Views
* User-configurable formatting will require rules around order of importance for palettes (Given a starting point color, propose a dark, medium, and light tinting as default)
* Palettes will also need to be multidimensional

## Kanban

- Dynamic Kanban column views derived from properties (columns) with drag-and-drop categories/hierarchies

* State management is key for navigation/usability (Card position really, really matters)
* Cards can be shown in multiple sizes with multiple attributes displayed

## Cards

- Card Elements: Title, Properties, and Content with smart preview (default images, then rendered HTML, then Title)

- Properties include Creation/Modification Dates, Tags, Folders, Attachments, Links, and Versions and are extensible

	- All Task Cards have a Checkbox for quick completion (move to Done then Archive with versioning)

- Notion-style MarkDown writing surface with slash commands

- Claude integrated for proactive/predictive tags and links and smart queries

Aggregate all disparate tasks and provide links into unified Tasks Cards and Calendar Views

Cards need texture and depth to stand out from the SuperGrid substrate and Liquid Glass may help here

## Graph

- Leverage SQLite property graph database extensions to show (and edit) Links between Cards by Dimensions like Obsidian and AnyType.

## Outline

- Hierarchical text representation of projects/cards by Categories and Tasks/Notes

## Calendars

- Time-based plans, actions, and events

* Custom views such as WeekMap (upcoming week at a glance: Tasks and Events) and Timelines (filtered Tasks and Events on user-configurable time horizons)
* Time filtering supports bitemporal time-series analytics with expressive user interface

## Capture

- Universal Inbox with unified views of Links, Mail, Messages, Notes, and Tasks Cards

* Supports agile movement (backlinks) of Cards into other Views

## UI Elements

### Tool Bar

Quick access to key application menu items, similar to other Apple Apps (notably Numbers, but also Mail and others)

### Command Bar

Primary keyboard-centric interface for slash commands as a proxy for menus:

- /new

- /open (.cardboard file or CSV import) prompt for most recent

	- /CSV to board

	- /CSV to card

- /save (.cardboard file or CSV export)

	- /export to CSV

	- /share

- /close

- /print

/model (invokes Dimensions navigation interface)

/view

	- /zoom (specify zoom level in percentage)

- /subtotal (automatically adds subtotals to subcategories and totals to categories, default operation is SUM, but configurable)

- /summary (shows subtotals and totals and hides non-calculated cells)

/inspector (for complex operations) 

/kanban (shifts to Cards View if in SuperGrid View)

/supergrid  (shifts to SuperGrid View if in  Cards View)

### Console

- Especially important when reaching far future potential features such as database UDFs and APIs, with Claude Code as the primary command bar interface 

## Utility features

- Undo/redo

* Search/replace
* Spellcheck
* Formatting cells, text, charts

| **FUNCTION TYPE*

* | **DESCRIPTION*

* | **EXAMPLE*

* |

|---|---|---|

| Date-Time | Temporal functions | date(year, month, day) |
