LinkedIn Extended Network Data Enrichment and Analytics (LIENDEA)

* import XLSX with first pass at Industry and organization segmentation (GTM plan)
* Scrape Reach for data enrichment: work email and phone number and connections
* Identify all key ICPs in those companies as targets and enrich their data
* Build an automated email and LinkedIn messaging campaign to engage target network via existing network
* Stay under the radar (rate limiting) throughout with both Reach/ERP and LinkedIn
