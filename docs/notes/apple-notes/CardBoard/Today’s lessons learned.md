Today’s lessons learned

Bottom to top is the correct way to build, from DDL/file format to Import to display to beyond

Cross-platform development seems to be optimized for a foundational library, then wrapped up in OS-specific implementations: CardBoardKit will be an interesting adventure here!

I’m so excited to use CardBoard to build CardBoard and everything else that follows!  WOOHOO!

Managing all my information from a single console is so exciting: film playlists, bank accounts, MTGs, plans, novels, Slack/Teams alerting, work automation, with room for so much more

I need to clarify that each Filter View (all contact cards aligned by company

 Navigation: starting with a horizontal array of dimensions and options

 Time slider: ruler, then histogram, then boundary arrows

 Data operations: demo button, privacy button (filter Play hashtags/folders)

 Need to clarify that each data set will have its own custom categories/properties and therefore needs to be considered a Filter View. Views of contacts, events, notes all have their own categories

 Basic pallette	- Blue: FutureME

* Green: Home
* Orange: Work

 A spreadsheet is a dataset type with a specific visualization style as pure SuperGrid, no cards?
