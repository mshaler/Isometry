Interesting insight tonight

SwiftUI/CloudKit won over React Native/D3.js, native integrations won over broad portability because SaaS can follow later on rewrite

In parallel Claude may have also won because Claude Code is a vastly superior experience so far and if Apple really does the xCode integration with Claude, then even more reason

Cards are primarily Notes, but embedded data types are also cards (virtual cards ?) such as tasks, contacts, links

 Write the spec

 Include all the artifacts

 Follow the best practices methodology
