CardBoard = THE INDEX

One of the most important or at least most interesting aspects of this app is how it will help enrich and unify and ACTIVATE my personal semantic index, what I will call for now THE INDEX…

I think the power of really smart ETL and content-aware file format import are going to be a powerful combination. Just being able to capture and enrich all the metadata associated with Apple Notes will be a huge breakthrough.

The contrast to “Do one thing well” is striking. In this case: THE INDEX IS ALL THE THINGS JUST THE WAY I WANT TO SEE THEM.

A very specific implementation detail that is highly relevant just now is that I can incorporate the source code of PanWriter.app directly into CardBoard.app for my Markdown editing and conversion capabilities.
