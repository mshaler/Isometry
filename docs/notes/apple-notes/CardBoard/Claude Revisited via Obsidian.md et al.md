# Claude Revisited via Obsidian.md et al

 Export all Claude artifacts	- Ensure create/modify dates give us a workable timeline for organizing artifacts

 Import all Claude artifacts into Obsidian.md

 Review and highlight keeper sections for transclusion and hopefully this is exactly what Obsidian is good at

 Rebuild truth.MD and claude.MD

* (Not specific to CardBoard, but maybe Obsidian is also my interim readlater app with exports from Readwise, Apple Notes, and Safari Reading List? How much CAN I get out of Obsidian.md?)

Race to working SuperGrid ASAmfP, then do my work in SuperGrid—and with belts and suspenders via Nimbalyst and/or Obsidian

Notion is primarily for simple stuff (Alex) and as my interim CRM if I can’t get started with CardBoard in January—all the more reason to move fast

One exception: if Notion is a better office suite than my current hodge podge approach

 Acid test: Integrated email/calendar automation and task management

* All of which is to say: optionality enables solutions

And yes it’s really time to embrace VS Code with Claude extensions as well
