Taiichi Ohno, inventor of kanban

Japanese industrial engineer [Taiichi Ohno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiichi_Ohno) developed Kanban at the end of the 1940s. Ohno worked at Toyota, the car maker, and had been looking for ways to optimize manufacturing processes at the firm.

It was initially used to [manage inventory](https://teamhood.com/kanban/kanban-inventory/) and minimize waste by ordering stock when items dropped below a certain threshold. Since then, Kanban has been applied as a [Lean project management](https://teamhood.com/kanban/lean-kanban/)methodology to various sectors and is particularly popular today with software developers.
