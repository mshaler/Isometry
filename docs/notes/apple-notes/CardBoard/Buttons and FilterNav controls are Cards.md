Buttons and FilterNav controls are Cards

 Buttons trigger CardBoard URLs that launch Cards in context (default view decision tree: SG for given dataset, user-configured primary view, choose from custom views, MRU)

 FilterNav controls are also Cards but in Canvases and everything is D3.js therefore extensible with guardrails

 Every value is a card

 Both support x-callback-URLs, SQL, and templated/managed D3.js commands (sliders, selectors, maps, graphs, viz)

 Grid is one row per entity, one column per property including data enrichment and SG position values

 Only show card titles or thumbnails on launch in SG in order to be efficient with memory (esp. iOS)

 Pagination for Grid view 100 rows at launch, then lazy load rest (with progress bar modal?)

 Cards can also launch templates and apps

 Background/batch DB operations

 Data enrichment pipelines (LinkedIn, being careful with rate limits)

 Photo chromatography analytics

 Sentiment analysis

 Top 10 interactions for contacts (materialized views?)

 D3D DSL?

 Rich data types in Grid and SuperGrid views are “property z-axis views” per header

 Auto-filter for columns is on by default in Grid

 Borrow from Notions checkbox row selection in grid and SuperGrid views

 Copy (command + C) operates on MRU canvas

 Everything is either Canvas or Card

 Canvas elements (default)

 Title

 Command bar

 Dataset ribbon canvas

 View ribbon canvas

 FilterNav panel canvases

 Views

 SG includes DN and Formula canvas

 Canvas tabs ribbon canvas

 Every Canvas and Card have a URL

 All links are live (real-time sync between views—you paste a SuperGrid URL into an App canvas and all views update live)

 Need to extend Gallery to include Canvases, especially Template Canvases
