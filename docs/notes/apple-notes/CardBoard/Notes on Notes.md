Notes on Notes

* Atomic notes in Apple Notes are awesome, but I need better linking to get better scaling, and I want to automate that in CardBoard
* I need Claude to update their to-do list in a kanban I can track in CardBoard

Command Bar is where all the meta-action happens in CardBoard:

* Models (XYZ): three rows of dimensions, user configurable for sorting, orientation (getting 3D right will be an interesting challenge)
* Formulas: One-click automated subtotal and summarization
* I need to fix Apple Notes Folders and hashtags and automate tuning/organization
* I need to have Claude recommend a better tuning ontology
* I need to have Claude build my HAPT donut view

* Where did my spellcheck go?!?
