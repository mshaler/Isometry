CardBoardDB is my workshop, CardBoard is all about the apps

* Finish data import UI
* Finish data integration UI
* Finish DB app
* Build Capture Shell
* Refactor plan
* Apps builder and publishing
* Python to Swift (or just D3.js?)

## Card Composer

Scalable visual representation of Cards in Views, especially SuperGrid, Graph, Kanban, Gallery, and Files—and syncs with SuperSize in SG/DN

- .5x just text of Title

* 1x icon and title
* 2x icon and thumbnail
* 3x double icon and title/thumbnail

App-specific 3x Cards example: LinkedIn

Icon 1: headshot (circle mask)

Icon 1 background: industry tint

Icon 2: company logo

Icon 2 background: org tint (border)

Title: text of name

Data cell colorization by sector (from upper left to lower right)

fME: blue gradient

Work: orange gradient

Home: green gradient

TimeParser is an adaptive approach to time dimension filter views (support smart time magnitudes)

* if dataset spans decades, then select decades and years as visible time dimensions in TimeSlider (selectable vertical mini-SG)
