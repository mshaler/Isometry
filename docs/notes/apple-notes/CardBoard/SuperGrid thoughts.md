SuperGrid thoughts

I want the same UX for CardBoard Shell as Claude Code for VS Code—can I just port the extension to CardBoard or run it as if CardBoard were VS Code? Simple Bowser becomes Preview and Capture is my code editor

Success for SuperGrid phase one: display and transpose

Maybe spanning axes and facets are also edges? An edge is also a card and we can transpose edges and nodes (Schroedinger’s graph?)

The IKE matrix is simply placing cards on a matrix of Cartesian coordinates with 0,0 at the center spanning +10 far left (most important) and +10 top (most urgent)
