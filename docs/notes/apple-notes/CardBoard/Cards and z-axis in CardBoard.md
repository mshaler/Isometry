Cards and z-axis in CardBoard

One of the challenges Claude Code has struggled with is getting SuperGrid and Dimension Nativgator synced and operating as envisioned. Here’s a way to make this simpler: by embracing the z-axis to align these two views and giving the user more power to directly interact with multidimensionality from different angles—and different layers in the Z-axis.

Here’s the source of the inspiration:

**DIMENSION NAVIGATOR IS JUST ANOTHER SUPERGRID VIEW**.  It is a side view of the stack of Dimension Cards, a flattened crosscut of dimensions that can be order/reordered/filtered in Dimension Wells. In other words, Janus enables us to see source data in yet another way, by aligning cells and Cards to their place in the z-axis.
**EVERY VALUE IS A CARD AND EVERY CARD HAS A Z-AXIS VALUE/POSITION**. In 3D terms, we typically look at SuperGrid (and spreadsheets more generally) from directly above and see it as a flat grid. Working our way from the lowest level of the z-axis from the bottom layer, we start with the flat grid composed of only cells.
**EVERY CELL IS A DATA CELL**. Ironically, trying to treat row and column headers as different and ambiguous entities was a *category error*. The only difference between cards and data cells is their position on the Z-axis.
**DIMENSIONS ARE CARDS WITH DIFFERENTIAL Z-AXES**. This approach helps us exercise more power and precision when it comes to selecting (filtering/sorting/grouping) Dimensions and children categories and data cell values.
**THE HIERARCHY OF CARDS IS REPRESENTED BY THEIR POSITION IN THE Z-AXIS**.  I’ve outlined the hierarchy of Cards in the attached Excel spreadsheet, outlining the following:

* Dimension Navigator as an additional SuperGrid view
* Where Dimensions fit in the SuperGrid

Where Dimensions and Cards align to the z-axis
