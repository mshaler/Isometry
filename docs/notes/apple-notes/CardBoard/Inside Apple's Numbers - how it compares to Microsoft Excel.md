**Inside Apple's Numbers - how it compares to Microsoft Excel**

[William Gallagher](https://appleinsider.com/editor/william+gallagher)Fri Aug 29 2025, 06:45 AM EDT
**Versus**

Numbers and Excel are among the most power apps you can get -- but you need to choose carefully

Apple's Numbers spreadsheet for Mac, [iPhone](https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone), and iPad, is not as powerful as Microsoft Excel, but most users will be hard-pressed to find its limitations — and will immediately see how much easier Numbers is for practically every use.

Numbers is a spreadsheet done in the typical Apple way of being powerful enough for the majority of users, but also hiding that power away. Sometimes it gets criticized for not having features that in fact it does, because Apple minimizes what controls it shows, until you need them.

This is a key part of why Numbers is more accessible and quicker to get used to than Excel. Plus it also has those Apple touches of not just accepting what spreadsheets used to be, and instead offering new ways of looking at what they can do.

Nonetheless, it is true that Numbers really does lack some features that Excel has. People who've managed to count it all, or track down documentation, say that Numbers has 262 functions built-in, while Excel has 400.

Those numbers don't tell the whole story, though. Excel has been adding even incredibly obscure functions and features ever since it was originally released — for the [Mac](https://appleinsider.com/inside/mac) at first — in 1987. Microsoft traditionally never removes anything either, so there will be functions no one still uses because newer ones have superseded them.

Top: It's hard to find the feature you in Excel. Bottom: Numbers hides distractions

In comparison, Numbers has been slowly updating since its launch in 2007. It's always been aimed at the broadest range of users, though, and Apple does not keep adding little-used features.

**The significant differences**

The problem is that beyond certain broad categories of differences, it's hard to look at the two apps and know which is right for you. As a sample of the differences most likely to be of concern, the key differences are:

- Excel has much better pivot table features than Numbers

* Excel has Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), though the Mac version is limited
* Numbers has only limited statistical analysis compared to Excel
* Excel can connect to SQL databases

Excel can handle much larger numerical datasets

Note that Numbers can import data you download from SQL databases, it's just that it's possible to connect Excel to them directly.

Excel (top) can have more rows and columns than Numbers (bottom)

Of all of these, possibly the most significant concerns the amount of data the two spreadsheet apps can handle. In any one spreadsheet, Numbers can have around 50,000 fewer rows than Excel, and 15,000 fewer columns. Specifically:

Excel can have 1,048,576 rows with 16,384 columns

Numbers can have 1,000,000 rows with 1,000 columns

Both apps can have multiple sheets within one spreadsheet file, though, and both can refer across those sheets. So typically you might want a totals spreadsheet, and it displays figures taken directly from the four quarterly sales sheets you have in the same file.

In Numbers, you can have easier-to-read separate tables, but still sum the values of one in the other

Excel can do this, though, even when the data you want to show in your summary is in a completely different spreadsheet document. When you open your summary sheet, Excel will prompt you to let it update all of its figures from those other linked sheets, and Numbers just can't do that.

So if you already know that you are going to need very large datasets, to link dynamically across multiple documents, and perform statistical analysis on them, you need to use Excel.

Before all of the reasons to use Numbers, though, there is one more specific circumstance where you should go straight to Excel. It's when you are going to be regularly working with Excel users — especially ones on PCs.

**Cross-platform problems**

Strictly speaking, Numbers is available on PCs — but only through its online version on iCloud.com. Numbers solely runs natively on the Mac, iPhone, and [iPad](https://appleinsider.com/inside/ipad), and that iPad app also runs on [Apple Vision Pro](https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-vision-pro).

It doesn't matter, though. You won't get PC users to switch to iCloud.com for Numbers, and especially not if they are heavy Excel devotees.

PCs and Macs work on different date systems and this tick box is a Band-aid at best

You can open Excel spreadsheets in Numbers, and you can also export Numbers sheets in Excel's .xlsx format. For most individual users, and probably most small businesses, this works fine.

But there are limitations, and there also problems. The obvious limitation is that if Numbers does not support a particular function, the imported sheet will potentially show error messages.

Possibly worse, it could instead import the last-calculated value of those functions. So a cell that you believe has a formula behind it is in fact just a straight number.

Plus while there have been steps taken to address it, to this day there remains a date problem between Mac and PCs. Excel works out dates based the number of days since a specified default date, and that default is different on the two platforms.

The default starting date for all calculations on the PC is January 1, 1900. The default on the Mac is January 1, 1904.

Apple did this all the way back in its earliest system software partly because it avoided an issue over how some computers incorrectly assumed 1900 was a leap year.

Solving a problem back then, though, means creating one forever afterwards. It remains possible that if you move a spreadsheet from PC to Mac you can have all of your date calculations change incorrectly.

The solution is to get all Excel users to switch to the 1904 date system, which they can through their app's settings. But unless you're all starting fresh today, there will be older sheets and you won't know for sure which system they're using.

**Where Numbers shines**

All of this makes it sound as if Excel is the gold standard and Numbers just an also-ran. That's not a completely unreasonable position, but Excel is at best a tarnished gold.

Excel has preposterous failures built in, and that is not counting how people misuse it. Even ignoring how, for instance, the UK government [lost Covid data](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/05/how-excel-may-have-caused-loss-of-16000-covid-tests-in-england) because it put them in columns instead of rows, it's claimed that [24% of Excel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb2zkxHDfUE) business spreadsheets contain mistakes.

The columns versus rows error is on those users, they can't blame Microsoft for that. But the degree of mistakes, the sheer volume of spreadsheet errors, that points to Excel being hard to use.

Numbers lets you have different tables on the same sheet

Maybe it should be. This is complex stuff that businesses and even lives depend on, so nobody would prefer ease of use over accuracy.

Not even Apple, though it has tried to find a balance between ease of use and performance throughout Numbers.

Of all the design touches such as not overloading the user with ribbons full of tools, there are two key examples of how Apple looks for the easier, or the more human approach:

Semantic numbers

Tables as well as sheets

Both of these need explaining. Semantic numbers means that Numbers users can easily refer to cells by their meaning instead of solely by their row and column cell number.

So normally you might multiply, say cell F9 by cell A12. But if its columns are correctly labelled, Numbers lets you instead multiply, say, "Cars Sold" by "Commission Earned."

Semantic values mean in Numbers you can write the names instead of the cell numbers

That seems small, yet it means when you're writing a sheet, you are far less likely to enter the wrong cell details into your formula. It is a such a significant usability benefit that it's surprising Excel doesn't do it.

Then if you're used to any other spreadsheet app, you may not even spot an Apple feature that is designed for newcomers. It's this business of tables in the sheet and how differently they work in Numbers.

In Excel, you have a spreadsheet document that has worksheets in it. Each sheet is what you think of when you say spreadsheet, and so far Numbers is the same.

But Numbers lets you use the worksheet as a canvas that has many tables on it. A table here is a complete unit, with its own headers, its own column widths and formatting.

So instead of accommodating every column or row heading you ever need, you can have one table that contains one set of data, and another that has something else. Then you can, for instance, sum all of the totals in either table and display the result in a third — which you then make a chart from.

**Charts in Numbers**

Excel offers several chart types that Numbers does not, such as waterfall ones, sunburst, and histogram charts. You tend to have to need them to even know what they're for, but they're part of the statistical analysis that Excel is better for than Numbers.

Excel can do Waterfall charts, but Numbers can't.

But Numbers includes more than 150 different chart types, ranging across the most familiar flat bar and line graphs, to 3D ones and interactive charts. An interactive chart includes a slider that lets you drag between, say, years in a summary chart and animate the changing totals.

Each chart in Numbers is inserted into the current table in the current sheet, and it's done by just clicking on the Chart button in the top toolbar.

So it's easy to get to the charts, very easy to pick one — and then just as easy to switch to another. Plus even the non-interactive ones like the 3D charts can be rotated to present a clearer view.

Sometimes Numbers does seem to be as much about presenting your results as it is working them out. If you are preparing an actual presentation, you can just copy a table or a chart straight out of Numbers and paste it onto your slides.

It's just a shame that you can't make that be an active, dynamic link so that changing the Numbers spreadsheet would automatically update the Keynote presentation.

**Not perfect, but very good**

Even aside from the specific feature differences between it and Excel, Numbers does have the odd bug. They don't seem to be consistent but, for instance, printing out tables is sometimes said to be problematic.

Fixing a rogue formatting bug in Numbers

In the case of *AppleInsider*, one key spreadsheet that solely has currency information will occasionally show percentages instead of US dollars. It's easy enough to fix:

Select the whole column

Click on the Format button

Choose Cell

Change the Date Format from Automatic to Currency

But it shouldn't happen, and there's no clear pattern why it does, or when it will. It's most likely to be user error, and some keystroke or mis-entered data, but once a column has been specifically set to one format, it shouldn't be automatically altered.

**Deciding on features, ease of use, and price**

Apple Numbers does trounce Microsoft Excel in one specific area — the cost. Numbers is free to all Mac, iPhone, and iPad users. Microsoft Excel pricing needs Microsoft Excel to work out.

For example, Excel can be bought outright on its own for around $180, but it's also available with Word, Outlook, and PowerPoint in Office. The standalone price for that is [regularly discounted](https://www.stacksocial.com/sales/microsoft-office-home-business-for-mac-2021-lifetime-license-7?aid=a-o0oxk613) in sales, to anywhere from $50 to $70.

Subscribing to Microsoft Excel — this literally is not the half of all the different price options

Except when you buy it as a one-time deal instead of a subscription, you get an older version of the app. And then if you buy it under a subscription, you get the newest and the constantly updated version — but you have to pick from 11 slightly different editions of Microsoft 365 Business, starting at $72/year.

And that's the business side. For home users, there are two options to pick from, starting at $100/year.

If you're in a corporation there are departments who'll figure out the right version for you, and also pay it. And if you're in a corporation, the odds are you will be better off working in Excel for compatibility with your colleagues.

But otherwise, Numbers is quick to learn, and it presents its spreadsheets particularly clearly. Plus if it's not as powerful as Excel, it is still very powerful and likely to be sufficient for individuals and for small to medium businesses.
